                <h2 class="head">Our Story: Weaving Passion into Every Saree</h2>
                <p>Trendy Drapes was born from a simple yet profound love for the timeless elegance of the Indian saree. As a child, I watched my grandmother meticulously drape her beautiful Kanjivaram sarees, each one a story of tradition, artistry, and grace. It was in those moments that I fell in love with this six-yard wonder.</p>
                <p>Years later, I realized that many of these incredible, handcrafted textiles were becoming harder to find. Trendy Drapes was created with a mission: to bridge the gap between skilled artisans and modern women who appreciate authentic, high-quality drapes. Our goal isn't just to sell sarees; it's to share a piece of India's rich cultural heritage, one thread at a time.</p>

                <h2 class="head2">The Art of the Drape</h2>
                <p>Every saree you find at Trendy Drapes is a testament to the skill and dedication of our talented weavers. We work directly with artisan communities across India, from the silk weavers of Kanchipuram to the master block printers of Rajasthan. This direct partnership ensures that every piece is ethically sourced and of the highest quality.</p>
                <p>Our process is a labor of love. It begins with the careful selection of threads, followed by the intricate weaving or hand-painting that can take weeks or even months. We believe in slow fashion—creating pieces that are not only beautiful but also built to last. When you wear a Trendy Drapes saree, you're not just wearing a garment; you're carrying forward a legacy of craftsmanship.</p>
            
                <h2 class="head2">Meet the Founder</h2>
